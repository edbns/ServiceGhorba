# Complete Guide to Regional CV Formats in 2025

Landing a job in today's global market often means understanding the specific CV formatting expectations of different countries and regions. What works in Canada might not work in Germany, and a US resume format could hurt your chances in Japan. Here's your comprehensive guide to getting it right.

## Why Regional Formatting Matters

Different countries have evolved unique hiring practices based on:
- **Legal requirements** (privacy laws, discrimination prevention)

Using the wrong format can result in immediate rejection, regardless of your qualifications.
