# No Degree? No Problem. Here's What to Write Instead

**"I can't apply for that job—they want a degree and I don't have one."**

Stop right there. While some positions truly require specific degrees, **many job postings use "degree preferred" as a lazy screening tool** rather than a real requirement. Here's how to build a CV that shows you're qualified, degree or no degree.

## The Truth About Degree Requirements

### What Job Postings Really Mean:
- **"Degree Required"** = Usually negotiable if you have relevant experience
- **"Degree Preferred"** = They'd consider someone without one

### What Employers Actually Want:
1. **Someone who can do the job well**
