## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "But I Don't Have a Degree"
**Reality:** Many successful restaurant managers started as servers. Your experience, work ethic, and customer service skills matter more than formal education.

### "My English Isn't Perfect"
**Reality:** Being multilingual is a HUGE advantage in hospitality. Restaurants actively seek staff who can serve diverse customers.

### "I've Only Worked at Small Places"
**Reality:** Small restaurants often require more diverse skills. You've probably done everything from serving to cleaning to inventory—that's valuable experience.

### "I Don't Know How to Write About Serving Food"
**Reality:** You're not just "serving food." You're managing customer relationships, handling money, working in teams, and solving problems under pressure.

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: List Everything You Do
Write down every task, responsibility, and achievement from your restaurant work—no matter how small.

### Step 2: Translate Tasks into Achievements
For each task, ask: "How did I do this well?" or "What was the result?"

### Step 3: Use Action Words
Start bullet points with: Achieved, Managed, Increased, Improved, Trained, Coordinated, Resolved

### Step 4: Add Numbers When Possible
- How many customers per shift?
- What was your sales average?
- How many new people did you train?
- What was your attendance record?

### Step 5: Get It Reviewed
Ask a manager, colleague, or friend to review your CV and suggest improvements.

## The Bottom Line

**Your restaurant experience IS professional experience.** The skills you've developed serving customers, working in teams, and handling pressure are exactly what employers in many industries are looking for.

Don't let anyone tell you that your work "doesn't count" or that you "don't need a CV." Every job deserves to be presented professionally, and every worker deserves opportunities for advancement.
