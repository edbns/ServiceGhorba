# How to Write a Killer CV in 2025

The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever. With AI tools becoming mainstream and remote work changing hiring practices, your CV needs to stand out from the crowd. Here are our top strategies for creating a compelling resume that gets noticed.

## 1. Optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)

Most companies now use ATS to filter resumes before human eyes see them. To pass these systems:

- Use standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include relevant keywords from the job description
- Avoid complex formatting, tables, or graphics
- Use a clean, simple font like Arial or Calibri
- Save as both PDF and Word formats

## 2. Lead with Impact, Not Duties

Instead of listing what you did, focus on what you achieved:

**Before:** "Responsible for managing social media accounts"
**After:** "Increased social media engagement by 150% and grew follower base from 1K to 15K in 6 months"

## 3. Quantify Everything

Numbers grab attention and provide concrete evidence of your value:

- Revenue generated or saved
- Percentage improvements
- Team sizes managed
- Projects completed
- Deadlines met

## 4. Tailor for Each Application

Generic CVs don't work anymore. For each application:

- Research the company and role
- Match your experience to their requirements
- Use their language and terminology
- Highlight relevant achievements
- Adjust your professional summary

## 5. Keep It Concise

Recruiters spend 6-10 seconds scanning a CV initially:

- 1-2 pages maximum for most roles
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Prioritize recent and relevant experience
- Remove outdated skills and irrelevant jobs

## 6. Modern Design Principles

Your CV should look professional and modern:

- Plenty of white space
- Consistent formatting
- Clear hierarchy with headings
- Professional color scheme (like our signature #043fff)
- Easy-to-read fonts

## 7. Include a Strong Professional Summary

Your summary is prime real estate - make it count:

- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Include your years of experience
- Mention key skills and achievements
- Align with the target role

## Conclusion

Creating a standout CV in 2025 requires balancing ATS optimization with human appeal. Focus on achievements, use data to tell your story, and always tailor your content to the specific role and company.
